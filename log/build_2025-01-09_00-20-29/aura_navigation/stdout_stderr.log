[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnav2_simple_commander.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "nav2_simple_commander", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "nav2_simple_commander" with any of the following names:

    nav2_simple_commanderConfig.cmake
    nav2_simple_commander-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nav2_simple_commander" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "nav2_simple_commander_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "nav2_simple_commander" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
